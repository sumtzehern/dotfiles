# Managing Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs, often starting with a dot (e.g., `.vimrc`, `.bashrc`). Managing these files in a systematic way can help streamline customization across different machines.

## Benefits of Managing Dotfiles

Managing dotfiles offers several advantages:

- **Easy Installation:** When logging into a new machine, applying your customizations takes only a minute.

- **Portability:** Your tools will work consistently across different machines, ensuring a familiar environment.

- **Synchronization:** Update your dotfiles from anywhere, keeping them in sync across all your machines.

- **Change Tracking:** Maintaining dotfiles throughout your programming career benefits from version history, providing insights into long-lived projects.

*Note: Benefits cited from MIT Missing Semester Lecture 5 (2020) notes.*

## 1. Organize Dotfiles

Create a folder to store your dotfiles. For example, let's call it `dotfiles`.

```bash
mkdir ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```


## 2. Clone Dotfiles Repository

Clone a dotfiles repository from GitHub (or any other version control system) to your local machine. This repository should contain your preferred configurations.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

## 3. Move Existing Dotfiles

Move your existing dotfiles into this folder.

Some other examples of tools that can be configured through dotfiles are:

- bash - ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile
- git - ~/.gitconfig
- vim - ~/.vimrc and the ~/.vim folder
- ssh - ~/.ssh/config
- tmux - ~/.tmux.conf


```bash
mv ~/.bashrc ~/dotfiles/bashrc
mv ~/.bash_profile ~/dotfiles/bash_profile
mv ~/.gitconfig ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig
mv ~/.vimrc ~/dotfiles/.vimrc
mv ~/.vim ~/dotfiles/.vim
mv ~/.ssh/config ~/dotfiles/ssh_config
mv ~/.tmux.conf ~/dotfiles/.tmux.conf
```

## 4. Create Symbolic Links 

Create symbolic links to the dotfiles from your home directory. This step ensures that changes made in the dotfiles directory reflect in the actual configuration files.

```bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/bashrc ~/.bashrc
ln -s ~/dotfiles/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vim ~/.vim
ln -s ~/dotfiles/ssh_config ~/.ssh/config
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```

## 5. Make Hidden Files Visible

If needed, make hidden files visible in your file manager or terminal using the -a option with ls.

```bash
ls -a
```


Now, your dotfiles are organized, version-controlled, and easily transferable to new machines. This setup allows for quick customization and consistency across different environmentslo.
